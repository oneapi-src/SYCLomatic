Detailed Help
-------------

API calls from the original application, which do not have functionally
compatible SYCL\* API calls are removed if |tool_name| determines that it should
not affect the program logic.

Possible reasons for removal:

* SYCL currently does not support setting resource limits on devices.
* SYCL currently does not support associating USM with a specific queue.
* SYCL currently does not support query operations on queues.
* SYCL currently does not support capture operations on queues.
* SYCL currently does not support configuring shared memory on devices.
* SYCL currently does not support setting cache config on devices.
* SYCL currently does not support registering of existing host memory for use by device. Use USM to allocate memory for use by host and device.
* SYCL currently does not support setting flags for devices.
* SYCL currently does not support memory access across peer devices.
* There is no corresponding API in SYCL.
* The call is redundant in SYCL.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

Verify the code correctness.

For example, this original CUDA\* code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   __device__ void bar(int *a) {
     __ldg(a);
   }
   
   void foo() {
     cudaLimit limit;
     cudaStream_t stream;
     unsigned int flags;
     cudaSharedMemConfig config;
   
     cudaDeviceSetLimit(limit, 0);
     cudaStreamAttachMemAsync(stream, nullptr);
     cudaStreamQuery(stream);
     cudaDeviceSetSharedMemConfig(config);
     cudaDeviceSetCacheConfig(cudaFuncCachePreferNone);
     cudaSetDeviceFlags(flags);
     cuInit(0);
   }

results in the following migrated SYCL code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   void bar(int *a) {
     /*
     DPCT1026:0: The call to __ldg was removed because there is no corresponding
     API in SYCL.
     */
     *a;
   }
   
   void foo() {
     cudaLimit limit;
     dpct::queue_ptr stream;
     unsigned int flags;
     int config;
   
     /*
     DPCT1026:1: The call to cudaDeviceSetLimit was removed because SYCL currently
     does not support setting resource limits on devices.
     */
     /*
     DPCT1026:2: The call to cudaStreamAttachMemAsync was removed because SYCL
     currently does not support associating USM with a specific queue.
     */
     /*
     DPCT1026:3: The call to cudaStreamQuery was removed because SYCL currently
     does not support query operations on queues.
     */
     /*
     DPCT1026:4: The call to cudaDeviceSetSharedMemConfig was removed because SYCL
     currently does not support configuring shared memory on devices.
     */
     /*
     DPCT1026:5: The call to cudaDeviceSetCacheConfig was removed because SYCL
     currently does not support setting cache config on devices.
     */
     /*
     DPCT1026:6: The call to cudaSetDeviceFlags was removed because SYCL currently
     does not support setting flags for devices.
     */
     /*
     DPCT1026:7: The call to cuInit was removed because this call is redundant in
     SYCL.
     */
   }

which is rewritten to:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   void bar(int *a) {
     *a;
   }
   
   void foo() {
     cudaLimit limit;
     dpct::queue_ptr stream;
     unsigned int flags;
     size_t count;
     float *ptr;
     
     int config;
   }
