Use ``sycl::stream`` instead of ``printf`` if your code is used on the device.

Detailed Help
-------------

If the ``printf`` statement is used on the host and the device in your original
code, it does not change. To create output in |dpcpp|, ``sycl::stream`` must be
used on the device and ``printf`` must be used on the host.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

* If the ``printf`` statement is only used from the host, do not change your code.
* If the ``printf`` statement is only used from the device, use ``sycl::stream``
  instead of ``printf``.
