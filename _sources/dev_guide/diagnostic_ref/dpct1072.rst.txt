Detailed Help
-------------

SYCL\* currently does not support getting the available memory on the current
device.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

Try to:
(1) re-migrate the code without option ``--no-dpcpp-extensions=device_info``; or
(2) rewrite the code manually.

For example, this original CUDA\* code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   void foo() {
     size_t result1, result2;
     cudaMemGetInfo(&result1, &result2);
   }

results in the following migrated SYCL code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   void foo() {
     size_t result1, result2;
     /*
     DPCT1072:0: SYCL currently does not support getting the available memory on
     the current device. You may need to adjust the code.
     */
     result2 = dpct::get_current_device().get_device_info().get_global_mem_size();
   }

which is rewritten to:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   void foo() {
     size_t result1, result2;
     dpct::get_current_device().get_memory_info(result1, result2);
   }
