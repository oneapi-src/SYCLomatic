Message

.. _msg-1081-start:

The generated code assumes that *<pointer variable>* points to the global memory
address space. If it points to a local or private memory address space, replace
``address_space::global`` with ``address_space::local`` or
``address_space::private``.

Detailed Help
-------------

|tool_name| tries to deduce the address space of the memory that
*<pointer variable>* points to. If the tool cannot deduce the address space
(for example, the pointer variable is used by multiple functions), the tool will
use ``address_space::global``  and the warning will be emitted.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

Check the address space of the memory that <pointer variable> points to
and replace ``address_space::global`` with the correct address space.
