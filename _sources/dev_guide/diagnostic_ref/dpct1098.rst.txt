.. _msg-1098-start:

The *<expression text>* expression is used instead of the *<function name>* call.
These two expressions do not provide the exact same functionality. Check the
generated code for potential precision and/or performance issues.

.. _msg-1098-end:

Detailed Help
-------------

No exact functional equivalent of the function was found in SYCL\* so an
expression composed of other functions was used. Code precision and/or
performance may not be as expected. Verify the code for correctness and
performance.

Suggestions to Fix
