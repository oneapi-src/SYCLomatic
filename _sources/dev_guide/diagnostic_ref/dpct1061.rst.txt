Call to *<macro name>* macro was removed because it only contains code, which

Detailed Help
-------------

When a macro definition contains only code, which will be removed during migration,
|tool_name| removes the usage of the macro as well.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

Review the code and remove the macro definition if it is not needed.

For example, this original CUDA\* code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   #define MACRO(x, y) cublasGetAtomicsMode(x, y)
   void foo(cublasHandle_t h, cublasAtomicsMode_t *am) {
     MACRO(h, am);
     ...
   }

results in the following migrated SYCL\* code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   /*
   DPCT1026:0: The call to cublasGetAtomicsMode was removed because this call is
   redundant in SYCL.
   */
   #define MACRO(x, y)
   void foo(dpct::queue_ptr h, int *am) {
     /*
     DPCT1061:1: Call to MACRO macro was removed because it only contains code,
     which is unnecessary in SYCL.
     */
     ...
   }

which is rewritten to:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   void foo(dpct::queue_ptr h, int *am) {
     ...
   }
