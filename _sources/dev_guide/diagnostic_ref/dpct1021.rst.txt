Migration of ``cublasHandle_t`` in ``__global__`` or ``__device__`` function is
not supported. You may need to redesign the code

Detailed Help
-------------

The ``cublasHandle_t`` is migrated to the ``cl::sycl::queue``. Because SYCL\* 1.2.1
does not support device-side enqueue of the kernel, the usage of the ``cl::sycl::queue``
is not possible in SYCL kernels.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

Redesign the code to submit all kernels by the host program instead of device-side
enqueue.
