SYCL does not support the device property that would be functionally compatible

Detailed Help
-------------

Not all CUDA\* device properties currently have functionally compatible equivalents
in SYCL. If such a property is detected and it is the integer type, it will be
migrated to -1. If it is the Boolean type, it will be migrated to false or true
depending on the context.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

Review the logic and adjust it manually.
