.. _msg-1051-start:

SYCL does not support a device property functionally compatible with *<property name>*.
It was migrated to *<migrated token>*. You may need to adjust the value of
*<migrated token>* for the specific device.

Detailed Help
-------------

Not all CUDA\* device properties currently have functionally compatible equivalents
in SYCL\*. If such a property is detected and it is the integer type, it will be
migrated to -1. If it is the Boolean type, it will be migrated to false or true
depending on the context.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

Review the logic and adjust it manually.

.. include:: /_include_files/support-msg.txt

For example, this original CUDA code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

    void foo(cudaDeviceProp deviceProp) {
      size_t a = deviceProp.totalConstMem;
      ...
    }

results in the following migrated SYCL code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

    void foo(dpct::device_info deviceProp) {
      /*
      DPCT1051:0: SYCL does not support a device property functionally compatible
      with totalConstMem. It was migrated to get_global_mem_size. You may need to
      adjust the value of get_global_mem_size for the specific device.
      */
      size_t a = deviceProp.get_global_mem_size();
      ...
    }

which is rewritten to:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

    void foo(dpct::device_info deviceProp) {
      size_t a = deviceProp.get_global_mem_size();
      ...
    }
