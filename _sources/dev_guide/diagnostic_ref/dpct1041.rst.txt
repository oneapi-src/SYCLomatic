Detailed Help
-------------

SYCL\* uses exceptions to report errors, it does not use error codes. The original
code tries to get an error code, but SYCL does not require this functionality.
Therefore, 0 is used instead of an error code in the following statements:

* if
* while
* do
* for
* switch
* return
* function-like macro

You may need to rewrite this code.
