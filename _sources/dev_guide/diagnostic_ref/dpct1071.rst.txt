The placement of the FFT computational function could not be deduced, so it is
assumed out-of-place. You may need to adjust the code.

Detailed Help
-------------

If the last two arguments in the original API call are literally identical
(ignoring C-Style type casts) and both the plan call and the execution call are
in the same function, |tool_name| generates in-place placement.
Otherwise, it assumes out-of-place placement.

The difference of in-place and out-of-place may affect the value of ``FWD_DISTANCE``,
``BWD_DISTANCE``, ``INPUT_STRIDES``, and ``OUTPUT_STRIDES``.


Suggestions to Fix
------------------

If the placement is incorrect, you may need to manually add the necessary ``set_value()``
statements before the call to ``commit()``.
