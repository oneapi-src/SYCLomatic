The template argument of the *<type>* could not be deduced. You need to update
this code.

Detailed Help
-------------

This warning is generated when the template argument could not be deduced by the
|tool_name| because the variable of this type was not used directly in
the code. |tool_name| inserts "dpct_placeholder", instead of type,
in such cases.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

Replace the "dpct_placeholder" with the real argument.
