Message

.. _msg-1078-start:

Consider replacing ``memory_order::acq_rel`` with ``memory_order::seq_cst`` for
correctness if strong memory order restrictions are needed.

.. _msg-1078-end:

Detailed Help
-------------

``memory_order::acq_rel`` is a light-weight fence that is sufficient for memory synchronization in most programs. If a program needs total sequentially consistent
memory order to ensure correctness, replace ``memory_order::acq_rel`` with
``memory_order::seq_cst``.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

Replace ``memory_order::acq_rel`` with ``memory_order::seq_cst`` if stricter
memory order is needed.
