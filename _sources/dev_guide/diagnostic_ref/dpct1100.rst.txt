========

Message

.. _msg-1100-start:

Currently the DFT external workspace feature in the |mkl_long| (|mkl|) is only
supported on GPU devices. Use the internal workspace if your code should run on
non-GPU devices.

Detailed Help
-------------

The FFT of |mkl| can use either an internal workspace or external workspace during
computation. The internal workspace mode is supported on all devices, while the
external workspace mode is currently only supported on GPU devices.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

If you are running code on a non-GPU device, you can:

* Use ``dpct::select_device(<device_id>)`` to choose a GPU device.
* Call ``dpct::fft::fft_engine::use_internal_workspace(true)`` before invoking
  ``dpct::fft::fft_engine::commit()``.
