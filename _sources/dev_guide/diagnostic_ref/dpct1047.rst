Detailed Help
-------------

In cuBLAS\* and cuSolver\* getrf API, the LU factorization is done as ``P*A=L*U``;
in |mkl_long|_ API, it is done as
``A=P*L*U``. The result of the matrix P may be different.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

If the matrix P is only used in library API, ignore this warning. If P is used
other ways, you may need to adjust the value of P.
