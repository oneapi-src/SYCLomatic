Detailed Help
-------------

Replace work-group size 128 with a value of 256 or greater, if the hardware
supports it.

Use function ``dpct::device_info:: get_max_work_group_size()`` to determine the
maximum work-group size supported by the hardware.


Suggestions to Fix
------------------

Replace work-group size with a greater value for better performance, as supported
by the hardware.
