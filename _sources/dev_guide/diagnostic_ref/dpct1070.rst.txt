Message
-------

.. _msg-1070-start:

*<pointer variable name>* is allocated by ``dpct::dpct_malloc``. Use
``dpct::get_host_ptr<type>(pointer variable name)`` to access the pointer from
the host code.

Detailed Help
-------------

The memory referenced by this pointer is allocated by ``dpct::dpct_malloc`` and
cannot be directly accessed from the host code. You can access the memory from
the host code by transforming the pointer using the ``dpct::get_host_ptr`` function.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

Review the code and adjust it manually.
