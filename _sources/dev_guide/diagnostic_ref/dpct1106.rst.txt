Detailed Help
-------------

The CUDA\* function ``<function name>`` (for example ``cudaMemGetInfo`` or
``cuMemGetInfo``) was migrated with the Intel extensions for device information,
which may not be supported by all compilers or runtimes. You may need to adjust
the code.

For example, this original CUDA code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

     void foo() {
       size_t free_mem, total_mem;
       cudaMemGetInfo(&free_mem, &total_mem);
     }

results in the following migrated SYCL\* code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

     void foo() {
       size_t free_mem, total_mem;
       /*
       DPCT1106:0: 'cudaMemGetInfo' was migrated with the Intel extensions for device
       information which may not be supported by all compilers or runtimes. You may
       need to adjust the code.
       */
       dpct::get_current_device().get_memory_info(free_mem, total_mem);
     }

which is rewritten to:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

     void foo() {
       size_t free_mem, total_mem;
       dpct::get_current_device().get_memory_info(free_mem, total_mem);
       // free_mem should be adjusted
       free_mem = /*implementation defined*/;
     }

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

You may need to adjust the code.
