Detailed Help
-------------

The rounding mode could not be specified and the generated code may have different
accuracy than the original code. Verify the correctness. The SYCL\* math built-in
functions rounding mode is aligned with the OpenCL C 1.2 standard.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

Review the logic and adjust it.

For example, this original CUDA\* code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   __global__ void foo(double *res) {
     double a = 1.00001;
     double b = 100000000000000000;
     *res = __dadd_ru(a, b);
   }

results in the following migrated SYCL code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   void foo(double *res) {
     double a = 1.00001;
     double b = 100000000000000000;
     /*
     DPCT1013:0: The rounding mode could not be specified and the generated code
     may have different accuracy than the original code. Verify the correctness.
     SYCL math built-in function rounding mode is aligned with OpenCL C 1.2
     standard.
     */
     *res = a + b;
   }

which is rewritten to:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   void foo(double *res) {
     double a = 1.00001;
     double b = 100000000000000000;
     *res = a + b; // For precision, use: *res = sycl::nextafter(a + b, (double)INFINITY);
     
   }
