## License

SYCLomatic project is licensed under the terms of the Apache

## Contribution process

### Development

**NB**: For any changes not related to SYCLomatic, 
but rather to LLVM in general, it is strongly encouraged that you submit
the patch to https://llvm.org/ directly.
See [LLVM contribution guidelines](https://llvm.org/docs/Contributing.html)
for more information.

**NB**: A change in tool should be accompanied with
corresponding test changes.
See [Test SYCLomatic](GetStartedGuide.md#test-SYCLomatic)
section of Get Started guide for more information.

- Create a personal fork of the project on GitHub
  - For the SYCLomatic project, use **SYCLomatic** branch as baseline for your
    changes. See [Get Started Guide](GetStartedGuide.md).
- Prepare your patch
  - follow [LLVM coding standards](https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html)
  - [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) and
    [clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/) tools can be
    integrated into your workflow to ensure formatting and stylistic
    compliance of your changes.
  - use

    ```bash
    ./clang/tools/clang-format/git-clang-format `git merge-base origin/SYCLomatic HEAD`
    ```

    to check the format of your current changes against the `origin/SYCLomatic`
    branch.
    - `-f` to also correct unstaged changes
    - `--diff` to only print the diff without applying
- Build the project following
[Get Started Guide instructions](GetStartedGuide.md#build-SYCLomatic-toolchain).
- Run regression tests -
[instructions](GetStartedGuide.md#test-SYCLomatic-toolchain).

### Tests development

Every product change should be accompanied with corresponding test modification
(adding new test(s), extending, removing or modifying existing test(s)).

There are 2 types of tests which are used for SYCLomatic validation:
* SYCLomatic in-tree LIT tests including [check-clang-c2s](../../tree/SYCLomatic/clang/test/dpct)
 targets stored in this repository. These tests
should not have hardware (e.g. GPU, FPGA, etc.) or external software
dependencies (e.g. OpenCL, Level Zero, CUDA runtimes). These tests only have dependencies
on CUDA header files.  All tests not following
this approach should be moved to SYCLomatic end-to-end test repo.

    **Guidelines for adding SYCLomatic in-tree LIT tests**:
    - The LIT tests are used to check whether the migration result is expected. The
      test framework doesn't check whether LIT test itself can be built and run correctly. So
      make sure the each LIT test itself can be compiled with corresponding compiler
      tool chain before migration. Also it's better to make sure the migrated code
      can be built with SYCL compiler.

    - Add a helpful comment describing what the test does at the beginning and other comments throughout the test as necessary.

    - Try to follow descriptive naming convention for variables, functions as much as possible.
    Please refer [LLVM naming convention](https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html#name-types-functions-variables-and-enumerators-properly)

* [SYCLomatic end-to-end (E2E) tests](https://github.com/oneapi-src/SYCLomatic-test).
A test which requires full stack including backend runtimes (e.g. OpenCL,
Level Zero or CUDA) should be put to SYCLomatic E2E test suite following
[CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/oneapi-src/SYCLomatic-test/blob/SYCLomatic/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Commit message

- When writing your commit message, please make sure to follow
  [LLVM developer policies](
  https://llvm.org/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html#commit-messages) on the subject.
- For any SYCLomatic related commit, the `[SYCLomatic]` tag should be present in the
  commit message title. To a reasonable extent, additional tags can be used
  to signify the component changed, e.g.: `[ISSUE-NUM]`, `[DOC]`, `[NFC]`.
- For product changes which require modification in tests outside of the current repository
  (see [Test SYCLomatic toolchain](GetStartedGuide.md#test-SYCLomatic)).
  the commit message should contain the link to corresponding test PR.

### Review and acceptance testing

- Create a pull request for your changes following [Creating a pull request
instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
- CI will run a signed-off check as soon as your PR is created - see the
**check_pr** CI action results.
- CI will run several build and functional testing checks as soon as the PR is
approved.
  - A new approval is needed if the PR was updated (e.g. during code review).
- Once the PR is approved and all checks have passed, the pull request is
ready for merge.
- Sometimes unrelated fails can be observed in the PR. It's author
responsibility to find/guess the reason of these fails and post a comment in
the PR with:
  - possible reason of fails, ideally with a link to the PR, which caused fails
  - link to other PR(s), which expected to fix fails
  - person who is currently looking into fails
  - link to existing open issue
  - if author cannot identify any of these, the minimal action expected is to
    open a new [issue](/../../issues)
  - list of unrelated tests failing in pre-commit CI. This would enable easy
    access to them via github search functionality.

### Merge

Project maintainers merge pull requests using one of the following options:

- [Rebase and merge] The preferable choice for PRs containing a single commit
- [Squash and merge] Used when there are multiple commits in the PR
  - Squashing is done to make sure that the project is builable on any commit
- [Create a merge commit] Used for LLVM pull-down PRs to preserve hashes of the
commits pulled from the LLVM community repository

## Sign your work

Please use the sign-off line at the end of the patch. Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch. The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify
the below (from [developercertificate.org](http://developercertificate.org/)):

```
