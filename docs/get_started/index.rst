Get Started with |tool_name|
============================

|tool_name| assists in the migration of a developer's program that
is written in CUDA\* to a program written in |dpcpp_long|, which is based on
modern C++ and incorporates portable industry standards such as SYCL\*.

.. include:: /_include_files/intro_links_gsg.rst

.. note::

   Use of |tool_name| will result in a project that is not entirely
   migrated. Additional work, as outlined by the output of |tool_name|,
   is required to complete the migration.


Before You Begin
----------------

.. include:: /_include_files/before_begin_intro_gsg.rst

Certain CUDA header files (specific to your project) may need to be accessible
to |tool_name|. |tool_name| looks for these CUDA
header files in the default locations:

-  ``/usr/local/cuda/include``

-  ``/usr/local/cuda-x.y/include``, where *x.y* is one of these values:
   |cuda_versions|.

You can reference custom locations by pointing to them with the
``--cuda-include-path=<path/to/cuda/include>`` option in |tool_name|
command line.

.. note::

   The CUDA include path should not be the same as, or a child path of, the
   directory where the source code that needs to be migrated is located.

Currently, |tool_name| supports the migration of programs
implemented with CUDA versions |cuda_versions|. The list of supported languages
and versions may be extended in the future.

.. include:: /_include_files/env_setup_gsg.rst

The general invocation syntax from the operating system shell is:

.. code-block::

   dpct [options] [<source0>... <sourceN>]

.. note::

   ``c2s`` is an alias to the ``dpct`` command and may be used in it's place.

Built-in Usage Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To see the list of |tool_name|â€“specific options, use ``--help``:

.. code-block::

   dpct --help

To see the list of the language parser (Clang\*) options, pass ``-help``
as the Clang option:

.. code-block::

   dpct -- -help


Emitted Warnings
----------------

|tool_name| identifies the places in the code that may require your
attention during the migration of the files in order to make the code SYCL
compliant or correct.

Comments are inserted into the generated source files and displayed as warnings
in the output. For example:

.. code-block::

   /path/to/file.hpp:26:1: warning: DPCT1003:0: Migrated API does not return error code. (*,0) is inserted. You may need to rewrite this code.
   // source code line for which warning was generated

Migrate a Simple Test Project
-----------------------------

|tool_name| comes with several sample projects so you can explore
the tool and familiarize yourself with how it functions.

   *  -  Sample Project
      -  Description
   *  -  Vector Add DPCT

         +  ``vector_add.cu``
      -  The Vector Add DPCT sample demonstrates how to migrate a simple program
         from CUDA to SYCL. Vector Add provides an easy way to verify that your
         development environment is setup correctly to use |tool_name|.
   *  -  Folder Options DPCT

         +  ``main.cu``
         +  ``bar/util.cu``
         +  ``bar/util.h``
      -  The Folder Options DPCT sample shows how to migrate more complex projects
         and to use options.
   *  -  Rodinia NW DPCT

         +  ``needle.cu``
         +  ``needle.h``
         +  ``needle_kernel.cu``
      -  The Rodinia NW DPCT sample demonstrates how to migrate a Make/CMake
         project from CUDA to SYCL using |tool_name|.

Review the README file provided with each sample for more detailed information
about the purpose and usage of the sample project.

Try a Sample Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow these steps to migrate the Vector Add DPCT sample project using
|tool_name|:

#. Download the ``vector_add.cu`` sample.

#. Run |tool_name| from the sample root directory:

   .. code-block::

      dpct --in-root=. src/vector_add.cu

   The ``vector_add.dp.cpp`` file should appear in the ``dpct_output``
   directory. The file is now a SYCL source file.

#. Navigate to the new SYCL source file:

   .. code-block::

      cd dpct_output

   Verify the generated source code and fix any code that |tool_name|
   was unable to migrate. (The code used in this example is simple, so manual
   changes may not be needed). For the most accurate and detailed instructions
   on addressing warnings emitted from |tool_name|, see the
   **Addressing Warnings in Migrated Code** section of the
   `README files <https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/tree/master/Tools/Migration>`_.

   .. note::

      To compile the migrated sample, add ``-I<dpct_root_folder>/include`` to
      your compile command.
