|tool_name|  was not able to recognize the parameter value used
as a CUDA\* device attribute.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

Redesign the code logic to remove use of the device attribute.

For example, this original CUDA code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

    void foo(int *result, CUdevice device) {
      cuDeviceGetAttribute(result, CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_GPU_OVERLAP, device);
    }

results in the following migrated SYCL\* code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

    void foo(int *result, int device) {
      /*
      DPCT1028:0: The cuDeviceGetAttribute was not migrated because parameter
      CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_GPU_OVERLAP is unsupported.
      */
      cuDeviceGetAttribute(result, CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_GPU_OVERLAP, device);
    }

which is rewritten to:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

    void foo(int *result, int device) {
      // Assume the HW supports copy memory and execute a kernel concurrently
      *result = 1;
    }
