Suggestions to Fix
------------------

If there is straightforward mapping available on the SYCL\* side, use the mapping instead in the migrated CMake script;
If not, you need to implement a helper function in dpct.cmake, which is part of the migrated project, and use this helper function as the mapping in the migrated CMake script.
