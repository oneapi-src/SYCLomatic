Detailed Help
-------------

When using syclcompat header-only library to assist the migration, this API migration is not supported.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

For example, this original CUDA* code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   cudaChannelFormatDesc desc42 = cudaCreateChannelDesc<float4>();

results in the following migrated SYCL code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   /*
   DPCT1131:0: The migration of "cudaChannelFormatDesc" is not supported with
   SYCLcompat currently, please adjust the code manually.
   */
   /*
   DPCT1131:1: The migration of "cudaCreateChannelDesc" is not supported with
   SYCLcompat currently, please adjust the code manually.
   */
   cudaChannelFormatDesc desc42 = cudaCreateChannelDesc<sycl::float4>();

which need be rewritten to:

   This kind of code requires manual migration.
