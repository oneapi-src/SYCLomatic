Suggestions to Fix
------------------

Review the logic and adjust it manually.

For example, this original CUDA\* code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

    void foo(size_t *value){
      cudaDeviceGetLimit(value, cudaLimitPrintfFifoSize);
    }

results in the following migrated SYCL code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

    void foo(size_t *value){
      /*
      DPCT1029:0: SYCL currently does not support getting device resource limits.
      The output parameter(s) are set to 0.
      */
      *value = 0;
    }

which is rewritten to:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

    void foo(size_t *value){
      *value = totalBufferSize /* the first argument of the constructor of sycl::stream */;
    }
