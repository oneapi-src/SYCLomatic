Detailed Help
-------------

The warning is generated in the following cases:

#. In the original code one cuFFT handle may be associated with different streams,
   but |tool_name| could not detect which stream was used by cuFFT
   calls.
#. In the migrated code one or more commit calls need to be used, but the
   |tool_name| could not deduce how to generate the correct set of commit
   calls.

For example, this original CUDA\* code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:
  
     cufftPlan1d(plan, ...);
     cufftExecR2C(plan, ...); // this call is using default stream
     cufftSetStream(plan, s2);
     cufftExecR2C(plan, ...); // this call is using s2 stream

results in the following migrated SYCL\* code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:
  
     /*
     DPCT1075:0: Migration of cuFFT calls may be incorrect and requires review.
     */
     plan->commit(*s2); // wrong queue is used
     ...
     dft::compute_forward (...);
     ...                                  // missing commit call
     dft::compute_forward(...);

which is manually adjusted to:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:
  
     plan->commit(dpct::get_default_queue()); // using default queue
     ...
     dft::compute_forward (...);
     ...
     plan->commit(*s2); // added new commit call with *s2 queue
     dft::compute_forward(...);


Suggestions to Fix
------------------

Check that ``oneapi::mkl::dft::descriptor::commit()`` calls were generated
correctly and are using the correct queue parameter. Fix the code if needed by
adding missing commit calls and adjusting queue parameters.

Refer to the
`descriptor<precision, domain>::commit function <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/onemkl/developer-reference-dpcpp/2024-2/descriptor-precision-domain-commit.html>`_ for more information.
