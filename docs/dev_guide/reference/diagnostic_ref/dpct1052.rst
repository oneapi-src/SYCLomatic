.. _msg-1052-start:

SYCL does not support the member access for a volatile qualified vector type.
The volatile qualifier was removed. You may need to rewrite the code.

Detailed Help
-------------

The SYCL\* specification does not provide a volatile qualified version of
member access for vector type.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

Review the code and adjust it.

For example, this original CUDA\* code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   struct Complex : cuFloatComplex {
     float real() const volatile {
       return x;
     }
   };

results in the following migrated SYCL code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   struct Complex : sycl::float2 {
     float real() const volatile {
       /*
       DPCT1052:0: SYCL does not support the member access for a volatile qualified
       vector type. The volatile qualifier was removed. You may need to rewrite the
       code.
       */
       return const_cast<struct Complex *>(this)->x();
     }
   };

which is rewritten to:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   struct Complex : sycl::float2 {
     float real() const volatile {
       return const_cast<struct Complex *>(this)->x();
     }
   };
