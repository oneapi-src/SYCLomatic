Detailed Help
-------------

"<Library specific to CUDA>" is removed because it is not supported for use alongside
option "-fsycl" of SYCL compiler. You may need to check the build options.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

For example, this original CUDA\* code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   target_link_options(nvcv_util_compat
   PUBLIC
       -static-libstdc++
       -static-libgcc
       -Wl,--wrap=__libc_start_main
       -Wl,-u__cxa_thread_atexit_impl
   )

results in the following migrated CMake script:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   target_link_options(nvcv_util_compat
   PUBLIC
       # DPCT3002:1: "-static-libstdc++" is removed because it is not supported for use
       alongside option "-fsycl" of SYCL compiler. You may need to check the build
       options.
       -static-libgcc
       -Wl,--wrap=__libc_start_main
       -Wl,-u__cxa_thread_atexit_impl
   )

which is rewritten to:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   target_link_options(nvcv_util_compat
   PUBLIC
       -static-libgcc
       -Wl,--wrap=__libc_start_main
       -Wl,-u__cxa_thread_atexit_impl
   )
