Message

.. _msg-1073-start:

The field values of parameter ``<parameter name>`` could not be deduced, so the call was not
migrated. You need to update this code manually.

Detailed Help
-------------

|tool_name| could not deduce the field values of the call parameter,
which is used in the migrated code.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

Manually replace the non-migrated call with a |dpcpp| expression using the actual
field values of the parameters. 

For example, this original CUDA\* code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:
  
     CUDA_ARRAY_DESCRIPTOR *desc_ptr;
     CUDA_ARRAY_DESCRIPTOR desc;
     desc_ptr = &desc;
  
     Cuarray arr;
     cuArrayCreate(&arr, desc_ptr)

results in the following migrated SYCL\* code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:
  
     CUDA_ARRAY_DESCRIPTOR *desc_ptr; // line was not migrated and can be removed
     size_t desc_x_ct1, desc_y_ct1;
     unsigned desc_channel_num_ct1;
     sycl::image_channel_type desc_channel_type_ct1;
     desc_ptr = &desc; // line can be removed
  
     dpct::image_matrix_p arr;
     /* DPCT1073 warning */
     cuArrayCreate(&arr, desc_ptr) // line was not migrated and needs to be replaced

which is manually adjusted to:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:
  
     size_t desc_x_ct1, desc_y_ct1;
     unsigned desc_channel_num_ct1;
     sycl::image_channel_type desc_channel_type_ct1;
  
     dpct::image_matrix_p arr;
     arr = new dpct::image_matrix(desc_channel_typ_ct1, desc_channel_num_ct1, desc_x_ct1, desc_y_ct1);
