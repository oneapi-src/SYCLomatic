There is no exact match between the ``maxGridSize`` and the ``max_nd_range`` size.

Detailed Help
-------------

There is no analogue of the ``maxGridSize`` in SYCL\*. SYCL ``nd_ranges`` can have
up to three dimensions, just like grids in CUDA, but there is no maximum of
``nd_range`` size beyond the data type width, which is ``size_t``. The
|tool_name| replaces the ``maxGridSize`` with the ``max_nd_range_size``
helper, which is initialized to the ``size_t`` width.

Suggestions to Fix

Verify the code correctness.
