Message
-------

.. _msg-1055-start:

Vector types with size 1 are migrated to the corresponding fundamental types,
which cannot be inherited. You need to rewrite the code.

Detailed Help
-------------

The warning message is emitted when vector type with size 1 is inherited by a
class or struct in the original code. Since the vector type with size 1 is
migrated to the corresponding fundamental type in |dpcpp| and the fundamental type
cannot be inherited, you need to rewrite the code.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

You can declare a new field with the corresponding fundamental type, for example
int for int1, in the class/struct and override the required operators.

For example, the following migrated SYCL\* code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

     class MyClass : int {
       ...
     }

is manually adjusted to:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

     class MyClass {
       int x;
       MyClass operator+(const MyClass& y) { ... }
       MyClass operator=(const MyClass& y){...}...
     }
