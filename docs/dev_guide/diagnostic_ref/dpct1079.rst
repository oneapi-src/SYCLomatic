Detailed Help
-------------

The first argument of ``dlopen()`` or ``LoadLibraryA()`` should be the path to the
dynamic library (for example ``.so`` on Linux\* or ``.dll`` on Windows\*).

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

Build the dynamic library from the migrated module file and replace
“dpct_placeholder” with the file path.
