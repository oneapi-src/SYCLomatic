Variable *<variable name>* was used in host code and device code.
*<variable name>* type was updated to be used in SYCL device code and new
*<host variable name>* was generated to be used in host code. You need to update
the host code manually to use the new *<host variable name>*.

Detailed Help
-------------

If ``__constant__variable`` is used in both host code and device code (for example,
the variable is included in two compilation units and they are compiled by different
compilers), it will be migrated to a ``dpct::constant_memory`` object and a new
host variable *<host variable name>*.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

You need to update the host code manually to use the new *<host variable name>*.
