.. _msg-1011-start:

The tool detected overloaded operators for built-in vector types, which may
conflict with the SYCL 2020 standard operators (see 4.14.2.1 Vec interface).
The tool inserted a namespace to avoid the conflict. Use SYCL 2020 standard
operators instead.

Detailed Help
-------------

You may have overloaded operators for vector types such as ``double2``. This
resulted in a conflict because overloaded operators with the same signature are
also defined in the SYCL\* standard. |tool_name| adds the namespace
for overloaded operators to differentiate them from the ones defined in SYCL.
You may need to rewrite the code.
