Detailed Help
-------------

This warning is emitted when atomic API calls are used in macro definition and
this macro is not called in the code.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

If you want this macro to be migrated by |tool_name|, please
use the macro that needs migration in your code and pass the code to the tool
again. Otherwise you can update the code manually or ignore the warning.

For example, this original CUDA\* code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   #include <cstdio>
   
   #define ATOMIC_ADD(x, v)  atomicAdd(&x, v);
   
   void foo() {
     // User's code which is not related to ATOMIC_ADD
   }

results in the following migrated SYCL\* code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   #include <sycl/sycl.hpp>
   #include <dpct/dpct.hpp>
   #include <cstdio>
   
   /*
   DPCT1058:0: "atomicAdd" is not migrated because it is not called in the code.
   */
   #define ATOMIC_ADD(x, v) atomicAdd(&x, v);
   
   void foo() {
     // User's code which is not related to ATOMIC_ADD
   }

which is rewritten to:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   #include <sycl/sycl.hpp>
   #include <dpct/dpct.hpp>
   #include <cstdio>
   
   void foo() {
     // User's code which is not related to ATOMIC_ADD
   }
