Detailed Help
-------------

This warning is emitted when atomic API calls are used in macro definition and
this macro is not called in the code.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

If you want this macro to be migrated by |tool_name|, please
use the macro that needs migration in your code and pass the code to the tool
again. Otherwise you can update the code manually or ignore the warning.
