|mkl_long| (|mkl|) DFT currently does not support reporting of the workspace size.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

If the code does not use workspace size, ignore this warning. Otherwise, try to
rewrite the code to not rely on the non-migrated parameter. In |mkl| DFT,
workspace memory is managed by oneMKL. In most cases, removing both the explicit
allocation of a “work area” and the explicit setting of a “work area” is adequate.
