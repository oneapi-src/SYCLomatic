.. _msg-1056-start:

The use of *<variable name>* in device code was not detected. If this variable

Detailed Help
-------------

If ``__constant__`` variable is only used in host code, "__constant__" attribute
will be removed.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

If this variable is only used in host code, ignore this warning.

If the variable is also used in device code, you need to migrate this code again
with ``--extra-arg="-xcuda"`` passed to the tool to explicitly specify the code language.

For example, this original CUDA\* code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   // dpct --out-root out test.c --extra-arg=-xc
   
   // test.c 
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <cuda_runtime.h>
   
   static __constant__ const float aaa = 10.f;
   
   void foo(){
     printf("%f\n", aaa);
   }

results in the following migrated SYCL\* code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   /*
   DPCT1056:0: The use of aaa in device code was not detected. If this variable is
   also used in device code, you need to rewrite the code.
   */
   static const float aaa = 10.f;
   
   void foo(){
     printf("%f\n", aaa);
   }

which is rewritten to:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   static const float aaa = 10.f;
   
   void foo(){
     printf("%f\n", aaa);
   }
