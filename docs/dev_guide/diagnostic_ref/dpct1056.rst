Detailed Help
-------------

If ``__constant__`` variable is only used in host code, "__constant__" attribute
will be removed.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

If this variable is only used in host code, ignore this warning.

If the variable is also used in device code, you need to migrate this code again
with ``--extra-arg="-xcuda"`` passed to dpct to explicitly specify the code language.
