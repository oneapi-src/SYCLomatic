Detailed Help
-------------

Not all data type combinations are supported by ``mkl::blas::gem()``.

This may be due to one of the following reasons:

* Not all values of parameters could be evaluated in migration.
* The combination of matrix data type and scalar type is unsupported.

Use a supported data type to rewrite the code.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

Please refer to the `gemm topic <https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-mkl-dpcpp-developer-reference/top/blas-and-sparse-blas-routines/blas-level-3-routines/gemm.html>`_
of the IntelÂ® oneAPI Math Kernel Library (oneMKL) - Data Parallel C++ Developer
Reference for supported data types to fix the code manually.
