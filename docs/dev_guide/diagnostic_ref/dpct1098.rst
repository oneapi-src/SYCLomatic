.. _msg-1098-start:

The *<expression text>* expression is used instead of the *<function name>* call.
These two expressions do not provide the exact same functionality. Check the
generated code for potential precision and/or performance issues.

Detailed Help
-------------

No exact functional equivalent of the function was found in SYCL\* so an
expression composed of other functions was used. Code precision and/or
performance may not be as expected. Verify the code for correctness and
performance.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

Verify the code for correctness and performance.

For example, this original CUDA\* code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   __device__ void device(float *f) {
     float a = __ldg(&(f[10]));
   }

results in the following migrated SYCL code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   void device(float *f) {
     /*
     DPCT1098:0: The '*' expression is used instead of the __ldg call. These two
     expressions do not provide the exact same functionality. Check the generated
     code for potential precision and/or performance issues.
     */
     float a = f[10];
   }

which is rewritten to:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   void device(float *f) {
   #if defined(__NVPTX__) && defined(__SYCL_DEVICE_ONLY__)
     float a = sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental::cuda::lgd(&(f[10]));
   #else
     float a = f[10];
   #endif
   }
