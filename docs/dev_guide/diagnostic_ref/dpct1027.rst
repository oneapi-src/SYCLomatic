Detailed Help
-------------

API calls from the original application, which do not have functionally compatible
SYCL API calls are replaced with 0 if |tool_name| determines that
this call removal should not affect the program logic and at the same time the
return value of that call is used for error handling.

Possible reasons for replacement:

* SYCL currently does not support setting resource limits on devices.
* SYCL currently does not support associating USM with a specific queue.
* SYCL currently does not support query operations on queues.
* SYCL currently does not support capture operations on queues.
* SYCL currently does not support configuring shared memory on devices.
* SYCL currently does not support setting cache config on devices.
* SYCL currently does not support registering of existing host memory for use by device. Use USM to allocate memory for use by host and device.
* SYCL currently does not support setting flags for devices.
* SYCL currently does not support memory access across peer devices.
* There is no corresponding API in SYCL.
* The call is redundant in SYCL.
