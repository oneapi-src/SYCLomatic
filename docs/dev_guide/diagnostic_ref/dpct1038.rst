Detailed Help
-------------

When a kernel function call is used in a macro definition and the function name
is passed as a macro argument, the tool cannot determine the type of function
parameters. This may lead to incorrectly generated |dpcpp| code.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

Review the kernel call inside the macro definition and adjust it manually, if needed.
