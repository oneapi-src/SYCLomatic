Detailed Help
-------------

Not all CUDA\* device properties have functionally compatible equivalents in
SYCL\*. These device properties are not migrated.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

Review and rewrite the code manually.

For example, this original CUDA\* code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   void foo(int t) {
     cudaDeviceProp properties;
     cudaGetDeviceProperties(&properties, 0);
     int a = properties.regsPerBlock;
     if (a < t)
       code path 1
     else
       code path 2
   }

results in the following migrated SYCL code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   void foo() {
     dpct::device_info properties;
     dpct::get_device_info(properties, dpct::dev_mgr::instance().get_device(0));
     /*
     DPCT1090:0: SYCL does not support the device property that would be
     functionally compatible with regsPerBlock. It was not migrated. You need to
     rewrite the code.
     */
     int a = properties.regsPerBlock;
     if (a < t)
       code path 1
     else
       code path 2
   }

which is rewritten to:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   void foo() {
     dpct::device_info properties;
     dpct::get_device_info(properties, dpct::dev_mgr::instance().get_device(0));
     
     // You need apply code path1 or path2 depending on the num of registers available on
     // the target hardware.
     code path 1/2
   }
