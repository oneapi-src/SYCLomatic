The SYCL device version is different from CUDA Compute Compatibility. You may
need to rewrite this code.

Detailed Help
-------------

|tool_name| detected a usage of CUDA\* Compute Capability-dependent
logic in the original program.

|dpcpp| does not support CUDA Compute Capability. The logic in the generated code
uses a version extracted from the ``cl::sycl::info::device::version``, which is
different than CUDA Compute Capability.


Suggestions to Fix
------------------

Review the logic and adjust it.
