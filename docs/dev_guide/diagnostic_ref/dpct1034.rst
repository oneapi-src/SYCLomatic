Migrated API does not return an error code. 0 is returned in the lambda. You
may need to rewrite this code.

Detailed Help
-------------

Typically, this happens because the API call in the original application returns
an error code and then it is consumed by the program logic.

SYCL\* uses exceptions to report errors and does not return the error code.

|tool_name| inserts a ``return 0;`` statement at the end of
the lambda expression, if the return code is expected by the program logic and
the new API does not return it. Review all such places in the code.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

If in a |dpcpp| application you:

* Do not need the code that consumes the error code, remove the code and the
  ``return 0;`` statement.
* Need the code that consumes the error code, try to replace it with an exception
  handling code and use your logic in an exception handler.
