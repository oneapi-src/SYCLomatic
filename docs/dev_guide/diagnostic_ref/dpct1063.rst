Advice parameter is device-defined *<additional action>*. You may need to adjust it.

Detailed Help
-------------

The advice value is device-defined advice for the specified memory allocation. A
value of 0 reverts the advice to the default behavior. Replace the value with
the one required by your device.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

Consult with your hardware vendor to find a replacement.

For example, this original CUDA\* code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   void foo(int *devPtr, int device, size_t count) {
     cudaMemAdvise(devPtr, count, cudaMemAdviseSetReadMostly, device);
   }

results in the following migrated SYCL\* code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   void foo(int *devPtr, int device, size_t count) {
     /*
     DPCT1063:0: Advice parameter is device-defined and was set to 0. You may need
     to adjust it.
     */
     dpct::get_device(device).default_queue().mem_advise(devPtr, count, 0);
   }

which is rewritten to:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   void foo(int *devPtr, int device, size_t count) {
     dpct::get_device(device).default_queue().mem_advise(devPtr, count, 0);
   }
