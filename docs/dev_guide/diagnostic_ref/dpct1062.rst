Detailed Help
-------------

This warning is emitted when ``cudaReadModeNormalizedFloat`` is used as the third
argument of texture in the original code. Since SYCL\* Image doesn't support
normalized read mode, ``cudaReadModeNormalizedFloat`` will be ignored during
migration.

It may cause errors in the resulting code, for example, redefinition of overloaded
functions, if the overloaded functions are differentiated based on the texture
type in the original code.

For example, this original CUDA\* code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:
  
     __device__ void foo(const texture<char, 2, cudaReadModeNormalizedFloat> tex);
     __device__ void foo (const texture<char, 2, cudaReadModeElementType> tex);

results in the following migrated SYCL code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:
  
     void foo (dpct::image_accessor_ext<char, 2> tex);
     void foo (dpct::image_accessor_ext<char, 2> tex);

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

Review the code and update as needed.
