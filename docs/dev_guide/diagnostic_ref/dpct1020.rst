Message
-------

.. _msg-1020-start:

Migration of *<api name>*, if it is called from ``__global__`` or ``__device__``
function, is not supported. You may need to redesign the code to use the host-side
*<api name>* instead, which submits this call to the SYCL queue automatically.

.. _msg-1020-end:

Detailed Help
-------------

The warning message is generated in cases where the *<api name>* itself submits
the SYCL\* kernel to the command queue, and the caller of *<api-name>* is the
SYCL kernel that is submitted to the command queue itself. It results in device-side
enqueue of the kernel, which is not supported by SYCL 1.2.1.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

Redesign the code to use the host-side API, which submits this call to the SYCL
queue automatically.
