``local_mem_size`` in SYCL is not a complete equivalent of *<variable name>* in

Detailed Help
-------------

In CUDA\*, the ``sharedMemPerBlock`` reports the size of the shared memory in bytes
available per block. The SYCL\* equivalent of a CUDA block is a work-group. The SYCL
equivalent of shared memory is local memory. There is no limitation on the size of
the local memory per work-group in SYCL. There is a limit on the maximum size of
the local memory in bytes available per compute unit, which is exposed by the
``info::device::local_mem_size`` device descriptor in SYCL.
