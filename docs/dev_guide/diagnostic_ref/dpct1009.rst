Detailed Help
-------------

SYCL\* uses exceptions to report errors and does not use error codes. The original
code tries to get a string message through the error code, while SYCL does not
require such functionality.

To indicate that the code needs to be updated, a warning string is inserted.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

You may need to rewrite this code.
