Detailed Help
-------------

SYCL\* uses exceptions to report errors and does not use error codes. The original
code tries to get a string message through the error code, while SYCL does not
require such functionality.

To indicate that the code needs to be updated, a warning string is inserted.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

You may need to rewrite this code.

For example, this original CUDA\* code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   void foo() {
     float *f;
     cudaError_t err = cudaMalloc(&f, 4);
     printf("%s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
   }

results in the following migrated SYCL code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   void foo()
     float *f;
     int err = (f = (float *)sycl::malloc_device(4, dpct::get_default_queue()), 0);
     /*
     DPCT1009:1: SYCL uses exceptions to report errors and does not use the error
     codes. The original code was commented out and a warning string was inserted.
     You need to rewrite this code.
     */
     printf("%s\n",
            "cudaGetErrorString is not supported" /*cudaGetErrorString(err)*/);
   }

which is rewritten to:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   void foo() {
     float *f;
     try {
       f = (float *)sycl::malloc_device(4, dpct::get_default_queue())
     } catch (sycl::exception const &e) {
       std::cerr << e.what() << std::endl;
     }
   }
