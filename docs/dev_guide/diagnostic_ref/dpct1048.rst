The original value *<macro name>* is not meaningful in the migrated code and

Detailed Help
-------------

When API (calls, flags, etc.) are not meaningful in |dpcpp|, they may be removed
or replaced with 0, depending on how they are used.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

Review the code and adjust it.

For example, this original CUDA\* code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

    void foo() {
      double2 *h_A;
      cudaHostAlloc(&h_A, sizeof(double2), cudaHostAllocDefault);
    }

results in the following migrated SYCL\* code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

    void foo() {
      sycl::double2 *h_A;
      /*
      DPCT1048:0: The original value cudaHostAllocDefault is not meaningful in the
      migrated code and was removed or replaced with 0. You may need to check the
      migrated code.
      */
      h_A = sycl::malloc_host<sycl::double2>(1, dpct::get_default_queue());
    }

which is rewritten to:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

    void foo() {
      sycl::double2 *h_A;
      h_A = sycl::malloc_host<sycl::double2>(1, dpct::get_default_queue());
    }
