Message
-------

.. _msg-1049-start:

The work-group size passed to the SYCL kernel may exceed the limit. To get the
device limit, query ``info::device::max_work_group_size``. Adjust the work-group
size if needed.

Detailed Help
-------------

The work-group size passed to the SYCL\* kernel for SYCL device has a limit (see
SYCL 1.2.1 standard, 4.6.4.2 Device information descriptors).

This warning appears if dimensions of the local range could not all be evaluated,
or if the product of the dimensions of the local range is more than 256.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

Query ``info::device::max_work_group_size`` to define the work-group size limit
for the device you use. If the work-group size used in the code is below the limit,
you can ignore this warning. Otherwise, you need to decrease the work-group size.
