Detailed Help
-------------

API calls from the original application, which do not have functionally
compatible SYCL\* API calls are removed if |tool_name| determines that it should
not affect the program logic.

Possible reasons for removal:

* SYCL currently does not support setting resource limits on devices.
* SYCL currently does not support associating USM with a specific queue.
* SYCL currently does not support query operations on queues.
* SYCL currently does not support capture operations on queues.
* SYCL currently does not support configuring shared memory on devices.
* SYCL currently does not support setting cache config on devices.
* SYCL currently does not support registering of existing host memory for use by device. Use USM to allocate memory for use by host and device.
* SYCL currently does not support setting flags for devices.
* SYCL currently does not support memory access across peer devices.
* There is no corresponding API in SYCL.
* The call is redundant in SYCL.
