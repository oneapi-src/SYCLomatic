Detailed Help
-------------

API calls from the original application, which do not have functionally
compatible SYCL\* API calls are removed if |tool_name| determines that it should
not affect the program logic.

Possible reasons for removal:

* SYCL currently does not support setting resource limits on devices.
* SYCL currently does not support associating USM with a specific queue.
* SYCL currently does not support query operations on queues.
* SYCL currently does not support capture operations on queues.
* SYCL currently does not support configuring shared memory on devices.
* SYCL currently does not support setting cache config on devices.
* SYCL currently does not support registering of existing host memory for use by device. Use USM to allocate memory for use by host and device.
* SYCL currently does not support setting flags for devices.
* SYCL currently does not support memory access across peer devices.
* There is no corresponding API in SYCL.
* The call is redundant in SYCL.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

Verify the code correctness.

For example, this original CUDA\* code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   __device__ void bar(int *a) {
     __ldg(a);
   }

   __global__ void kernel() {
     return;
   }
   
   void foo() {
     cudaLimit limit;
     cudaStream_t stream;
     unsigned int flags;
     cudaSharedMemConfig config;
   
     cudaDeviceSetLimit(limit, 0);
     cudaStreamAttachMemAsync(stream, nullptr);
     cudaStreamQuery(stream);
     cudaDeviceSetSharedMemConfig(config);
     cudaDeviceSetCacheConfig(cudaFuncCachePreferNone);
     cudaSetDeviceFlags(flags);
     cuInit(0);
     float *aptr;
     cudaStreamAttrValue stream_attribute = {};
     stream_attribute.accessPolicyWindow.base_ptr = aptr;
     stream_attribute.accessPolicyWindow.num_bytes = 8 * 8 * 8;
     stream_attribute.accessPolicyWindow.hitRatio = 1.0f;
     stream_attribute.accessPolicyWindow.hitProp = cudaAccessPropertyPersisting;
     stream_attribute.accessPolicyWindow.missProp = cudaAccessPropertyStreaming;
     cudaStreamSetAttribute(stream, cudaStreamAttributeAccessPolicyWindow, &stream_attribute);
     cudaStreamGetAttribute(stream, cudaStreamAttributeAccessPolicyWindow, &stream_attribute);
     cudaCtxResetPersistingL2Cache();
     cuCtxResetPersistingL2Cache();
     cudaFuncSetAttribute(kernel, cudaFuncAttributeMaxDynamicSharedMemorySize, 8 * 8 * 8);
     cudaFuncSetAttribute(kernel, cudaFuncAttributePreferredSharedMemoryCarveout, 8 * 8 * 8);
   }

results in the following migrated SYCL code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   void bar(int *a) {
     /*
     DPCT1026:0: The call to __ldg was removed because there is no corresponding
     API in SYCL.
     */
     *a;
   }

   void kernel() {
     return;
   }
   
   void foo() {
     cudaLimit limit;
     dpct::queue_ptr stream;
     unsigned int flags;
     int config;
     float *aptr;

which is rewritten to:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

   void bar(int *a) {
