Detailed Help
-------------

When the tool cannot deduce the compute direction, the migration of Input/Output
distance may need to be updated manually.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

Update the migrated Input/Output distance according to the computing direction.
If the direction is forward computing, Input/Output distance should map to FWD/BWD_DISTANCE.
If the direction is backward computing, Input/Output distance should map to BWD/FWD_DISTANCE.
