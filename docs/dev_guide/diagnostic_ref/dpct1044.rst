Message
-------

.. _msg-1044-start:

*<BaseClass1>* was removed because *<BaseClass2>* has been deprecated in
C++11. You may need to remove references to typedefs from *<BaseClass1>* in the
class definition.

Detailed Help
-------------

*<BaseClass#>* is either ``unary_function`` or ``binary_function``. The ``std::``
equivalents for these classes are deprecated, and the use of these base classes
is removed.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

If any of the typedef identifiers are referenced in the class definition, they
should be replaced with the original template arguments.

For example, this original CUDA\* code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

    class C : thrust::unary_function<int, float> {
      argument_type arg_data;
      result_type result_data;
    };

results in the following migrated SYCL\* code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

    /*
    DPCT1044:0: thrust::unary_function was removed because std::unary_function has
    been deprecated in C++11. You may need to remove references to typedefs from
    thrust::unary_function in the class definition.
    */
    class C {
      argument_type arg_data;
      result_type result_data;
    };

which is rewritten to:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:
   
    class C {
      argument_type arg_data;
      result_type result_data;
    };
