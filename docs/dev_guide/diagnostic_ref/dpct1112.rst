If the filter mode is set to `linear`, the behavior of image "read" may be

Detailed Help
-------------

The CUDA\* `tex1Dfetch` function always applies the nearest filtering mode. In the migrated
code, the image read function applies the filtering mode that is set for the texture
object. There may be a different result on the image read, so you may need to align
the filter mode on image read.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

For example, this original CUDA code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

     cudaTextureDesc desc;
     desc.filterMode = cudaFilterModeLinear;
     ...
     cudaTextureObject_t obj;
     cudaCreateTextureObject(&obj, ..., &desc, ...);
     ...
     tex1Dfetch(..., obj, ...);


results in the following migrated SYCL\* code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

     dpct::sampling_info desc;
     desc.set(sycl::filtering_mode::linear);
     ...
     dpct::image_wrapper_base_p obj;
     obj = dpct::create_image_wrapper(..., desc);
     ...
     /*
     DPCT1112:0: If the filter mode is set to 'linear', the behavior of image
     "read" may be different from "tex1Dfetch" in the original code. You may need
     to adjust the code.
     */
     obj.read(...);


which is rewritten to:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:

     dpct::sampling_info desc;
     desc.set(sycl::filtering_mode::nearest);  // Update the filtering mode from linear to nearest
     ...
     dpct::image_wrapper_base_p obj;
     obj = dpct::create_image_wrapper(..., desc);
     ...
