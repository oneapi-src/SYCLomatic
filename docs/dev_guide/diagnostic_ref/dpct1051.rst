SYCL does not support a device property functionally compatible with *<property name>*.
It was migrated to *<migrated token>*. You may need to adjust the value of
*<migrated token>* for the specific device.

Detailed Help
-------------

Not all CUDA\* device properties currently have functionally compatible equivalents
in SYCL\*. If such a property is detected and it is the integer type, it will be
migrated to -1. If it is the Boolean type, it will be migrated to false or true
depending on the context.

Suggestions to Fix
------------------

Review the logic and adjust it manually.
