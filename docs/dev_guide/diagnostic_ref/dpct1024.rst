Message
-------

.. _msg-1024-start:

The original code returned the error code that was further consumed by the program
logic. This original code was replaced with 0. You may need to rewrite the program
logic consuming the error code.

Detailed Help
-------------

This warning is generated in cases where in the original code, the CUDA\* API call
returns the error code, which is consumed by the program logic:

.. code-block:: cpp

   handleError(cudaEventRecord(e));


If in the resulting code the CUDA API call is replaced by the code, which does
not return the error code, 0 is used as an input to the program logic, consuming
the error code:

.. code-block:: cpp

   e_ct1 = clock(), handleError(0);


The error handling code in that case must be verified and may require replacing
it with exception handling code or removed completely.

Suggestions to Fix

Verify the code correctness.
