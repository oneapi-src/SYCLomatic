Detailed Help
-------------

The CUDA ``<function name>`` for example ``cudaMemGetInfo`` or ``cuMemGetInfo`` was
migrated with Intel's Extensions for Device Information, which may be not supported
by all compilers or runtimes.

Original code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:
   void foo() {
     size_t free_mem, total_mem;
     cudaMemGetInfo(&free_mem, &total_mem);
   }
Migrated code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:
   void foo() {
     size_t free_mem, total_mem;
     /*
     DPCT1106:0: 'cudaMemGetInfo' was migrated with Intel's Extensions for Device
     Information which may be not supported by all compilers or runtimes. You may
     need to adjust the code.
     */
     dpct::get_current_device().get_memory_info(free_mem, total_mem);
   }
Fixed code:

.. code-block:: cpp
   :linenos:
   void foo() {
     size_t free_mem, total_mem;
     dpct::get_current_device().get_memory_info(free_mem, total_mem);
     // free_mem should be adjusted
     free_mem = /*implementation defined*/;
   }
Suggestions to Fix
------------------

You may need to adjust the code.
