Detailed Help
-------------

This warning is generated when |tool_name| detects more complex
error handling than it considers safe to remove.

The CUDA\* API returns error codes that are consumed by the program logic. SYCL\*
uses exceptions to report errors and does not return the error code.

When the error handling logic in the original code is simple (for example, a
print error message and exit), the code is removed in the resulting |dpcpp_long|
application. The expectation is that SYCL throws an exception, which is handled
with the printing of an exception message and exiting (the exception handler is
generated automatically by |tool_name|).


Suggestions to Fix
------------------

Review the error handling ``if-`` statement and try to rewrite it to use an
exception handler instead.
