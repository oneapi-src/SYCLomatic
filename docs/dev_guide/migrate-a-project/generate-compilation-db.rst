Generate a Compilation Database
===============================

A `compilation database <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html>`_
is a JSON file that contains an array of command objects, each of which usually
contains three parts:

* ``directory``: The working directory of the compilation. All paths specified
  in the command or file fields must be either absolute or relative to this directory.
* ``command``: The compile command.
* ``file``: The translation unit’s main source file that is processed in the
  compilation step.

The compilation database lists detailed build options for each translation unit’s
main source file, which can be consumed by |tool_name| to guide the code project migration.

For example:

.. code-block:: none
   :linenos:

   [
     {
       "directory": "/path/to/project",
       "command": "/usr/bin/clang++ ...  -Iinclude_path -D_FOO_=VALUE -c ./foo/foo.cpp",
       "file": "./foo/foo.cpp"
     },
     ...
     {
       "directory": "/path/to/project",
       "command": "/usr/bin/clang++ ... -Iinclude_path -D_BAR_=VALUE -c ./foo/bar.cpp",
       "file": "./foo/bar.cpp"
     }
   ]

A compilation database can be generated by running the ``intercept-build`` script,
which is provided as part of |tool_name|. ``intercept-build`` supports the capture
of compilation command lines for files with the following extensions: ``.c``, ``.C``, ``.cc``,
``.CC``, ``.cp``, ``.cpp``, ``.cxx``, ``.c++``, ``.C++``, ``.txx``, and ``.cu``.

Generate a Compilation Database for Makefile-Based Projects
-----------------------------------------------------------

The source code in Makefile-based projects can be compiled and linked into an
executable binary or library by running build commands specified in the project
Makefile.

For Makefile-based projects, you can generate the compilation database by running
``intercept-build make``.

Use the `folder-options-dpct <https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/tree/master/Tools/Migration/folder-options-dpct>`_ sample to show the generation of compilation database.

#. Change to the ``folder-options-dpct`` sample directory.
#. Run the intercept-build tool to generate the compilation database:

   .. code-block:: none

      intercept-build make

   The compilation datebase ``compile_commands.json`` is created in the sample directory.


Generate a Compilation Database for CMake-Based Projects
--------------------------------------------------------

CMake uses ``CMakeLists.txt`` files to describe project configuration, source
files, and dependencies. When using CMake, make sure that all software that ``CMakeLists.txt`` files depend on has been installed, so that a functional Makefile can be generated by CMake.

There are two options to generate compilation database for CMake-based projects:

#. Use ``intercept-build``
#. Use CMake option ``CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS``

Option One: Use intercept-build to Generate the Compilation Database
********************************************************************

The following steps show how to generate the compilation database using ``intercept-build``:

#. Install the required software dependencies for the project.
#. In a command window, go to the project folder.
#. In the project folder create and navigate to a new build directory:

   .. code-block:: none

      mkdir build && cd build

#. Run CMake to generate a Makefile:

   .. code-block:: none

      cmake ../

#. Run ``intercept-build`` to generate the compilation database:

   .. code-block:: none

	   intercept-build make

Option Two: Use CMake Option to Generate the Compilation Database
*****************************************************************

With CMake 3.5 version or higher, you can use the CMake option
``CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS`` to generate the compilation database. For example,
the following command generates the compilation database ``compile_commands.json``
in the build directory:

.. code-block:: none

    cmake  -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON ../

.. note::

   CMake 3.10 or higher is recommended as it provides better support for CUDA source code.

Generate a Compilation Database with Other Build Systems
--------------------------------------------------------

For projects using other build systems, ``intercept-build`` can be used to generate
a compilation database from the build log of the project.

When generating a compilation database from the build log of a project, make sure
to build your project using the appropriate build options to generate a verbose
build log.

For example:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50

   * - Build System
     - Option to Generate Verbose Build Log
   * - Make
     - ``VERBOSE=1``
   * - CMake/Ninja
     - ``-DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON``
   * - Bazel
     - ``--subcommands``


You can use the `folder-options-dpct <https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/tree/master/Tools/Migration/folder-options-dpct>`_ sample to show the generation of the compilation database based on the build log.

#. Change to the ``folder-options-dpct`` sample directory.
#. Run ``make`` with options to collect a verbose build log:

   .. code-block:: none

      make VERBOSE=1 -B > ./build_log.txt

	The content of ``build_log.txt`` should look like the following:

	.. code-block:: none
       :linenos:

       nvcc -c  -I./foo -I./foo/bar foo/main.cu -o foo/main.o
       nvcc -c  -I./foo -I./foo/bar foo/bar/util.cu -o foo/bar/util.o
       nvcc  ./foo/main.o ./foo/bar/util.o -o foo-bar

#. Use ``intercept-build`` to generate the compilation database with the ``--parse-build-log`` option to specify the build log to use:

   .. code-block:: none

      intercept-build --parse-build-log=build_log.txt --work-directory=./

   The compilation database ``compile_commands.json`` is generated in the
   current directory.
