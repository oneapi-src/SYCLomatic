Migrate a Project on Linux\*
============================

Use the Command Line
--------------------

You can invoke |tool_name| at the command line.

Use the ``dpct`` tool's ``--in-root`` option to specify the location of the
source that should be migrated:

* Any source within the ``--in-root`` directory (at any nesting
  level) may be migrated.
* Any header file within the ``--in-root`` directory (at any nesting level) that
  is included by the source or header file, which is being migrated, is also
  migrated.
* Files from outside the ``--in-root`` directory are considered system files and
  will not be migrated even if they are included by any of your program source
  files.
* If the ``--in-root`` option is not specified, the directory of the first input
  source file is implied.

Use the ``dpct`` tool's ``--out-root`` option to specify the directory where the
SYCL code produced by |tool_name| is written:

* Relative paths of the migrated files are maintained.
* Extensions are changed to ``.dp.cpp``.
* If the ``--out-root`` option is not specified, ``./dpct_output`` is implied.

The following steps show migration of the Folder Options sample using the
``dpct`` tool:

.. include:: /_include_files/wip.rst

#. Open the Folder Options sample:

   .. include:: /_include_files/open_sample_dgr.rst

#. Navigate to the root of the sample project.

   The Folder Options sample project contains a simple CUDA\* program with three
   files (``main.cu``, ``util.cu``, and ``util.h``) located in two folders
   (``foo`` and ``bar``).

#. From the parent folder of the unzipped foo folder, run |tool_name|:

   .. code-block:: none

      dpct --in-root=foo --out-root=result/foo foo/main.cu foo/bar/util.cu --extra-arg="-Ifoo/bar/"

   Use the ``--in-root`` option to specify the location of the CUDA
   files that need migration. Use the ``--out-root`` option to specify the
   location for the migrated files.
#. As a result, you should see the following files:

   * ``./result/foo/main.dp.cpp``
   * ``./result/foo/bar/util.dp.cpp``
   * ``./result/foo/bar/util.h``
#. Inspect the migrated source code, address any generated DPCT warnings, and
   verify correctness of the new program.

.. MIGRATION_MAKE_CMAKE

Use Make/CMake\* to Migrate a Complete Project
----------------------------------------------

If your project uses Make or CMake, you can utilize compilation database support
to provide compilation options, settings, macro definitions, and include paths
to |tool_name|.

The compilations database is a JSON\* file containing the commands required to
build a particular project. A compilation database can be generated by running
the ``intercept-build`` script, which is provided as part of |tool_name|.
``intercept-build`` supports the capture of compilation
command lines for files with the following extensions: ``.c``, ``.C``, ``.cc``,
``.CC``, ``.cp``, ``.cpp``, ``.cxx``, ``.c++``, ``.C++``, ``.txx``, and ``.cu``.

|tool_name| parses the compilation database and applies the necessary
options when migrating the input sources.

This example uses the Rodinia NW DPCT sample to demonstrate the use of a
compilation database.

**Step 1: Create the Compilation Database**

#. Open the Rodinia NW DPCT sample:

   .. include:: /_include_files/open_sample_dgr.rst

#. When using CMake: Before running ``intercept-build``, configure and generate
   your Makefile out of ``CMakeLists.txt``. An example of a typical command is
   ``cmake ...``.

#. Clean the application:

   .. code-block:: none

      make clean

#. Invoke the build command, prepending it with ``intercept-build``:

   .. code-block:: none

      intercept-build make

   The ``intercept-build`` script runs your project's build command without building
   the original program. It records all the compiler invocations and stores the
   names of the input files and the compiler options in the compilation database file:
   ``compile_commands.json``.

   .. note::

      This example assumes the CUDA headers are available at ``/usr/local/cuda/include``.
      Replace this path according to where they reside on your system.

#. Once ``intercept build`` is run, review the output in the
   ``compile_commands.json`` file. The content of this file should look like
   this example:

   .. code-block:: none
      :linenos:

      [{
        "command" : "nvcc -c -o needle -I/usr/local/cuda/include -D__CUDA_ARCH__=400 "
                    "-D__CUDACC__=1 needle.cu",
        "directory" : "/home/user/projects/DPCPP_CT/rodinia_3.1/cuda/nw",
        "file" : "/home/user/projects/DPCPP_CT/rodinia_3.1/cuda/nw/needle.cu"
      }]

**Step 2: Use the Compilation Database with the Migration Tool**

By default, |tool_name| looks for the ``compile_commands.json`` file
in the current directory and uses the compiler options from it for each input file.
The location of the compilation database file can be changed using the ``-p``
option.

For example, the following command  will migrate ``some_file.cu`` if the
information about it can be found in ``compiler_commands.json``,  located at
``<some_path>``.

.. code-block:: none

   dpct -p=some_path --in-root=../.. --out-root=dpct_output some_file.cu


To migrate all relevant files recorded inside the compilation database, use
a command similar to:

.. code-block:: none

   dpct -p compile_commands.json --in-root=. --out-root=migration

If you run the command above with the Rodinia NW DPCT sample, you
should see the following files in the ``migration`` out folder:

-  ``needle.h``
-  ``needle_kernel.dp.cpp``
-  ``needle.dp.cpp``


**Step 3: Verify the Source for Correctness and Fix Anything the Tool was Unable
to Migrate**

Verify the migration of the source code that uses variables declared
using preprocessor directives. Inspect the migrated source code, address any
generated DPCT warnings, and verify correctness of the new program.

Review :ref:`emitted-warnings` for additional information about inserted warnings
and comments.
