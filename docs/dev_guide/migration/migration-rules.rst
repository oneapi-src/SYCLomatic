Migration Rules
===============

|tool_name| uses migration rules to migrate CUDA\* code to SYCL\* code.
There are three categories of migration rules used by the tool:

* **Default migration rules.** A set of built-in migration rules used by the tool
  for all migrations.
* **Optional predefined migration rules.**  A set of predefined migration rules
  that can optionally be used for migration. Available predefined migration rules
  are in the *extensions/opt_rules* folder on the installation path of the tool.
* **User-defined migration rules.** Custom migration rules defined by the user.
  User-defined migration rules extend the migration capability of |tool_name|
  and can be used to target the migration of specific CUDA syntax to specific
  SYCL syntax.


Specify Migration Rule Files
----------------------------

To specify a predefined or user-defined migration rule file for use in migration,
use the ``–rule-file`` command line option with your migration command.

The ``–rule-file`` option can be used multiple times with a single command to
specify multiple migration rule files. For example:

.. code-block:: none

   dpct sample.cu --rule-file=rule_file1.YAML --rule-file=rule_file2.YAML


See the :ref:`cmd_opt_ref` for additional information.

Write User-defined Migration Rules
----------------------------------

Migration rules are specified in YAML files. A single rule file may contain multiple migration rules. To define a rule, use the following
<key>: <value> pairs:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 20 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Key
     - Value
     - Description
   * - Rule
     - String value
     - Required. Specifies the unique name of the rule.
   * - Priority
     - ``Takeover`` | ``Default`` | ``Fallback``
     - Required. Specifies the priority of the rule: ``Takeover`` > ``Default`` > ``Fallback``.
       When there are rule conflicts, the rule with higher priority will take precedence.
   * - Kind
     - ``Macro`` | ``API`` | ``Header`` | ``Type`` | ``Class`` | ``Enum`` | ``DisableAPIMigration`` | ``PatternRewriter`` | ``CMakeRule``
     - Required. Specifies the rule type.
   * - CmakeSyntax
     - String value
     - Required. Specify the CMake syntax name that will be migrated. Use the unique name for the CMake syntax.
   * - MatchMode
     - ``Partial`` | ``Full`` | ``StrictFull``
     - Optional. Specify the match mode with full word match, strict full word match, or partial word match. If not specified, partial match mode will be used. The partial matching mode means the matched string can be surrounded by arbitrary characters including whitespace. The full matching mode means the matched string should not be surrounded by identifier characters (letters, numbers, and underscore). The strict matching mode means the matched string should only be surrounded by whitespace characters.
   * - In
     - String value
     - Required. Specifies the target name in the input source code.
   * - Out
     - String value
     - Required. Specifies the final format in the output source code.
   * - Includes
     - List of header files
     - Required. Specifies the header files which should be included in the output source code. The value can be an empty list.
   * - EnumName
     - String value
     - Specifies the name of an enum for an Enum rule type.
   * - Fields
     - String value
     - Specifies the migration rule of fields in a Class rule type.
   * - Methods
     - String value
     - Specifies the migration rule of methods in a Class rule type.
   * - Prefix
     - String value
     - Specifies the prefix of a Header rule type. For example: ``#ifdef ...``
   * - Postfix
     - String value
     - Specifies the postfix of a Header rule type. For example: ``#endif ...``
   * - Subrules
     - String value
     - Specifies the subrules for the PatternRewriter rule type.
   * - APIRestrictCondition
     - List of restrictions
     - Specifies the restrictions for the API.

For example, the following user-defined migration rule file demonstrates different
rule types. The behavior of each rule is explained in the corresponding comment:

.. code-block:: none

Grammar for Out Key in a User-defined API Migration Rule
--------------------------------------------------------

To describe the value format for the ``Out`` key in a migration rule of
``Kind: API``, use the following Backus-Naur form grammar:

.. code-block:: none

   OutValue::= Token | Token OutValue       # OutValue is the value for the "out" key
   Token::= AnyString | Keyword             # AnyString is a string provided by the user
   Keyword::= ArgIndex
      | $queue                              # Represents the queue string
      | $context                            # Represents the context string
      | $device                             # Represents the device string
      | $deref(ArgIndex)                    # The dereferenced value of the argument
      | $type_name_of(ArgIndex)             # The type name of the argument
      | $deref_type(ArgIndex)               # The dereferenced type name of the argument
      | $addr_of(ArgIndex)                  # The address of the argument
   ArgIndex::= $Int                         # Int should be a greater than zero integer


The following scenario describes how the tool makes use of a user-defined
migration rule that uses this grammar to migrate code.

Consider the following user-defined API migration rule:

.. code-block:: none

   - Rule: rule_foo
     Kind: API
     Priority: Takeover
     In: foo
     Out: $type_name_of($2) new_ptr = bar($deref($1), $3)
     Includes: ["<header3>"]

If the input source code contains a function call that matches the rule, the
tool parses the value of the ``In`` and ``Out`` keys and builds a keyword mapping
between the input and output source code. For example, with input source code:

.. code-block:: none

   int *ptr, *ptr2;
   foo(ptr, ptr2, 30);

The tool creates the following mapping:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 40 30
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Keyword
     - Input Source Code Match
     - Migration Result
   * - ``$1``
     - ``ptr``
     - ``ptr``
   * - ``$2``
     - ``ptr2``
     - ``ptr2``
   * - ``$3``
     - ``30``
     - ``30``
   * - ``$type_name_of($2)``
     - N/A
     - ``int*``
   * - ``$deref($1)``
     - N/A
     - ``*ptr``

Using this mapping, the tool migrates the input source code into the following
output source code:

.. code-block:: none

   int *ptr, *ptr2;
   int * new_ptr = bar(*ptr, 30);
