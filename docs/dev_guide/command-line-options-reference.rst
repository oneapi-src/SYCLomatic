     - Generates makefile for migrated file(s) in ``-out-root`` directory.
       Default: ``off``.
   * - ``--help``
     - Provides a list of ``dpct`` specific options.
   * - ``--in-root=<dir>``
     - The directory path for the root of the source tree that needs to be migrated.

       - The directory of the first input source file, if the input source files are provided.

       Details:

       Any source within the directory specified by ``--in-root`` (at any nesting
       level) may be migrated. Any header file within the directory specified by
       ``--in-root`` (at any nesting level) included by the source or header file,
       which is being migrated, is also migrated. Files from outside the ``--in-root``
       directory are considered system files and they will not be migrated even
       if they are included by any of the program source files.
   * - ``--in-root-exclude=<dir|file>``
     - Excludes the specified directory or file from processing.
   * - ``--keep-original-code``

   * - ``--no-cl-namespace-inline``
     - DEPRECATED: Do not use ``cl::`` namespace inline. Default: ``off``. This
       option will be ignored if the replacement option ``--use-explicit-namespace``
       is used.
   * - ``--no-dpcpp-extensions=<value>``
     - A comma-separated list of extensions not to be used in migrated code.
       By default, these extensions are used in migrated code.

       - ``=enqueued_barriers``: Enqueued barriers extension.
       - ``=device_info``: Use the Intel extensions for device information if supported
         by the compiler and the backend.
   * - ``--no-dry-pattern``
     - Do not use a Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) pattern when functions from the
       ``dpct`` namespace are inserted. Default: ``off``.
   * - ``--no-incremental-migration``
     - Tells the tool to not perform an incremental migration. Default: ``off``
       (incremental migration happens).
   * - ``--optimize-migration``
     - Generates SYCL code applying more aggressive assumptions that
       potentially may alter the semantics of your program. Default: ``off``.
   * - ``--out-root=<dir>``
     - The directory path for root of generated files. A directory is created if
       it does not exist. Default: ``dpct_output``.

       The relative paths for the generated files are maintained, and the
       extension is changed as follows:

       - ``*.cu → *.dp.cpp``
       - ``*.cpp → *.cpp.dp.cpp``
       - ``*.cc → *.cc.dp.cpp``
       - ``*.cxx → *.cxx.dp.cpp``
       - ``*.C → *.C.dp.cpp``
       - ``*.cuh → *.dp.hpp``
       - ``*.h *.hpp *.hxx`` → extensions are kept the same
   * - ``--output-file=<file>``
     - Redirects the ``stdout``/``stderr`` output to ``<file>`` in the
       output directory specified by the ``--out-root`` option.
   * - ``--output-verbosity=<value>``
     - Sets the output verbosity level:

       - ``=silent``: Only messages from clang.
       - ``=normal``: 'silent' and warnings, errors, and notes from |tool_name|.
       - ``=detailed``: 'normal' and messages about which file is being processed.
       - ``=diagnostics``: 'detailed' and information about the detected conflicts
         and crashes (default).
   * - ``-p=<dir>``
     - The directory path for the compilation database (``compile_commands.json``).
       When no path is specified, a search for ``compile_commands.json`` is
       attempted through all parent directories of the first input source file.
   * - ``--process-all``
     - Migrates or copies all files, except hidden, from the ``--in-root``
       directory to the ``--out-root`` directory. The ``--in-root`` option should
       be explicitly specified. Default: ``off``.

       Details:

       If ``--process-all`` and ``--in-root`` options are specified, but no
       input files are provided, the tool migrates or copies all files, except
       hidden, from the ``--in-root`` directory to the output directory.

       - If there is a compilation database:

         - Files from the compilation database are migrated with the options
           specified in the compilation database
         - Files with the ``.cu`` extension that are not listed in the compilation
           database are migrated as standalone
         - Remaining files are copied to the ``–out-root`` directory

       - If there is no compilation database:

         - Files with the ``.cu`` extension are migrated as standalone
         - Remaining files are copied to the ``-out-root`` directory

       ``--process-all`` is ignored if input files are provided on the command line.
   * - ``--report-file-prefix=<prefix>``
     - Prefix for the report file names. The full file name will have a suffix
       derived from the ``report-type`` and an extension derived from the
       ``report-format``. For example: ``<prefix>.apis.csv`` or ``<prefix>.stats.log``.
       If this option is not specified, the report goes to ``stdout``. The report
       files are created in the directory, specified by ``-out-root``.
   * - ``--report-format=<value>``
     - Format of the reports:

       - ``=csv``: The output is lines of comma-separated values. The report name
         extension will be ``.csv`` (default).
       - ``=formatted``: The output is formatted for easier human readability.
         The report file name extension is ``log``.
   * - ``--report-only``
     - Only reports are generated. No SYCL code is generated. Default: ``off``.
   * - ``--report-type=<value>``
     - Specifies the type of report. Values are:

       - ``=apis``: Information about API signatures that need migration and the
         number of times they were encountered. The report file name has the
         ``.apis`` suffix added.
       - ``=stats``: High level migration statistics: Lines Of Code (LOC) that
         are migrated to SYCL, LOC migrated to SYCL with helper functions,
         LOC not needing migration, LOC needing migration but are not migrated.
         The report file name has the ``.stats`` suffix added (default).
       - ``=all``: All reports.
   * - ``--rule-file=<file>``
     - Specifies the rule file path that contains rules used for migration.
   * - ``--stop-on-parse-err``
     - Stop migration and generation of reports if parsing errors happened. Default: ``off``.
   * - ``--suppress-warnings=<value>``
     - A comma-separated list of migration warnings to suppress. Valid warning IDs
       range from 1000 to 1100. Hyphen-separated ranges are also allowed. For

         migrated code and place them in the ``--out-root`` directory.
       - ``=all``: Generate a complete set of helper header files and place them
         in the ``--out-root`` directory.
   * - ``--use-dpcpp-extensions=<value>``
     - A comma-separated list of extensions to be used in migrated code.
       By default, these extensions are not used in migrated code.

         (provided by Intel(R) oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler) and C/C++ Standard Library
         to migrate functions which have no mapping in the SYCL standard.
         If this value is used together with ``intel_device_math``, the ``intel_device_math``
         functions take precedence.
       - ``=intel_device_math``: Use ``sycl::ext::intel::math`` functions from the libdevice

Source Files
------------

To work with source files use ``<source0> ...`` to create paths
for your input source files. These paths can be found in the
compilation database.

Examples:

-  Migrate single source file: ``dpct source.cpp``
-  Migrate single source file with C++11 features:
   ``dpct --extra-arg="-std=c++11" source.cpp``
-  Migrate all files available in compilation database:
   ``dpct -p=<path to location of compilation database file>``
-  Migrate one file in compilation database:
   ``dpct -p=<path to location of compilation database file> source.cpp``
