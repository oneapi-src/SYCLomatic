DPCT Namespace Usage Guide
==========================

The DPCT namespace provides helper functions and macros to assist the migration
of input source code. DPCT namespace helper functions are implemented in header
files and are available in the include folder (include/dpct) of the
|tool_name| install path. These header files are intended to become part
of your new SYCL\* code generated by |tool_name|. You can copy these
header files if needed and include them with the generated code.

There are three namespaces defined:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Namespace
     - Description
   * - ``dpct::``
     - This namespace is used in the code generated by |tool_name|.
   * - ``dpct::detail::``
     - This namespace is an internal implementation and should not be used in
       SYCL source files directly, as the API and implementations inside the
       ``dpct::detail::`` namespace can be changed at any time without notice.
   * - ``dpct::deprecated::``
     - This namespace is for functionality that has been introduced for
       compatibility purposes, but relies on deprecated C++ features, that have
       been removed or will be removed in the future standards. Use of deprecated
       functionality in the ``dpct::deprecated::`` namespace should be avoided.

.. note::

   After migration, it is recommended that you continue
   development using SYCL and C++ standard APIs, rather
   than continue development based on DPCT namespace helper
   functions and macros.

The following sections describe different domains of helper
functions and macros in more detail.

Macros
------

The following table lists the macros used to control the behavior of the helper
functions:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Macro
     - Description
   * - ``DPCT_USM_LEVEL_NONE``
     - If the ``--usm-level=none`` option of |tool_name| is used, then
       ``DPCT_USM_LEVEL_NONE`` is defined before DPCT namespace helper header
       files are included into migrated code. By default, this macro is not
       defined. If ``DPCT_USM_LEVEL_NONE`` is defined, corresponding helper
       functions guarded by this macro are active, and the resulting migrated
       code will use buffer-based memory functions instead of USM-based memory
       functions.
   * - ``DPCT_NAMED_LAMBDA``
     - If the ``--sycl-named-lambda`` option of |tool_name| is used,
       then ``DPCT_NAMED_LAMBDA`` is defined before DPCT namespace helper header
       files are included in migrated code. By default, this macro is not defined.
       If ``DPCT_NAMED_LAMBDA`` is defined, corresponding helper code guarded by
       this macro is active and the resulting migrated code is using it.
   * - ``DPCT_COMPATIBILITY_TEMP``
     - ``DPCT_COMPATIBILITY_TEMP`` is defined as an integer number in helper header
       files, and is inserted into migrated code by |tool_name|.
       You can replace this macro in the generated code or change the value of
       ``DPCT_COMPATIBILITY_TEMP`` according to your needs.

.. note::

   Do not manually define these macros. They are automatically defined by
   |tool_name| according to the  options specified in the
   ``dpct`` command line.

Atomic Helper Functions
-----------------------

The atomic helper functions are available in the ``atomic.hpp``
header file. Atomic helper functions are wrappers around standard
SYCL atomic operations.

Device Helper Functions
-----------------------

The device helper functions are available in the ``device.hpp`` header file.

The following classes are defined in the ``device.hpp`` header file:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Class
     - Description
   * - ``device_info``
     - ``device_info`` is used to present information enumerated by SYCL device
       information descriptors.
   * - ``device_ext``
     - ``device_ext`` is a subclass of SYCL device class ``cl::sycl::device``.

       ``device_ext`` adds a default SYCL queue associated with the device on
       top of SYCL device, along with interface to query device information, and
       initializes ``device_info`` class.
   * - ``dev_mgr``
     - ``dev_mgr`` is a singleton, intended to manage all SYCL-capable devices
       available on the system (for example CPU or GPU). ``dev_mgr`` selects one of
       the available devices as current device, according to the behavior of SYCL
       default device selector. Display the current device using ``current_device()``,
       and change the current device using ``select_device()``.

Find more details in the ``device.hpp`` file.

The following table lists the device helper functions:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Function
     - Description
   * - ``get_current_device()``
     - Returns the current device in the device manager.
   * - ``get_default_queue()``
     - Returns the default queue associated with the current device in the
       device manager.
   * - ``get_device(unsigned int id)``
     - Returns the ``device_ext``\ object by integer id.
   * - ``cpu_device``
     - Returns the ``device_ext`` object associated with the SYCL CPU device.
   * - ``get_default_context()``
     - Returns the SYCL context of the default queue associated with the current
       device in device manager.


Memory Helper Functions
-----------------------

The following table lists SYCL buffer-based memory model helper functions:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Function
     - Description
   * - Device Memory Manager (``mem_mgr`` )
     - Device memory manager is a singleton, intended to assist with migration
       of memory API calls if a SYCL buffer-based memory model is used. It provides
       API to allocate and free host virtual address space bound to
       ``cl::sycl::buffer``, and transform between the host virtual address and
       ``cl::sycl::buffer``. By default, the ``mem_mgr`` maintains 128GB of
       virtual memory space. You can change virtual memory space as required by
       changing the value of ``mapped_region_size`` in the ``memory.hpp`` file.

The following table lists helper functions to get the SYCL buffer from host virtual
address:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Function
     - Description
   * - ``get_buffer_and_offset(const void *ptr)``
     - Where ``ptr``\ is the host virtual address. This function returns the
       ``cl::sycl::buffer`` bound to the host virtual address, and the offset of
       the host virtual address in the ``cl::sycl::buffer``.
   * - ``get_buffer(const void *ptr)``
     - Where ``ptr``\ is the host virtual address. Returns the ``sycl::buffer``
       bound to the host virtual address.


**General Helper Functions**

General memory helper functions are used to assist the migration
of memory API calls, like memory allocation, memory copy, and
memory set, for both USM and buffer-based memory model. The following helper
functions are available:

* ``dpct_malloc()``
* ``dpct_free()``
* ``dpct_memcpy()``
* ``async_dpct_memcpy()``
* ``dpct_memset()``
* ``async_dpct_memset()``

Find more details in the ``memory.hpp`` file.

**Helper Functions Assisting Migration of Device Memory
Variables**

To assist with migration of variables declared with global and
constant device memory attributes, the helper functions provide
the following template classes:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Function
     - Description
   * - ``global_memory``
     - Represents a SYCL global memory variable.
   * - ``constant_memory``
     - Represents a SYCL constant memory variable.
   * - ``shared_memory``
     - Represents memory that can be accessed by host and device, in the same
       way as SYCL USM shared memory.

The following table lists main member functions of memory classes:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Function
     - Description
   * - ``get_prt()``
     - Returns memory pointer of the memory object. It is a virtual pointer when
       buffer-based memory model is used, and it is a device pointer when a USM
       memory model is used.
   * - ``get_size()``
     - Returns the size of a memory object.
   * - ``get_access()``
     - Returns the accessor to the memory object. If a USM memory model is used,
       this function returns a ``dpct_accessor_t`` object for the device memory
       object. ``dpct_accessor_t`` is a helper type, which contains the data
       pointer, data dimension information, and provides a method to access the
       memory. If a buffer-based memory model is used, this function returns
       ``cl::sycl::accessor`` for the device memory object.
   * - ``init()``
     - Allocates memory after a SYCL device is selected, and initializes device
       memory if it has initial value. This API should be called after the SYCL
       device is selected.


Kernel Helper Functions
-----------------------

Kernel helper functions provide a structure ``kernel_function_info`` to keep
SYCL kernel information, and provide a utility function ``get_kernel_function_info()``
to get the kernel information.

Image Helper Functions
----------------------

The image helper functions provide class wrappers to assist the migration of
texture API. Find more details on image helper functions in the ``image.hpp`` file.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Wrapper
     - Description
   * - Template class ``image_wrapper``
     - The wrapper of ``cl::sycl::image``. It provides methods to attach/detach
       1D/2D/3D data to/from ``cl::sycl::image`` and method ``get_access()`` to
       return the SYCL image accessor.
   * - Class ``image_accessor_ext``
     - Wraps SYCL sampler and SYCL image accessor together. Provides the ``read()``
       method to read data from the accessor.
   * - Class ``image_data``
     - Represents the data used to create a ``cl::sycl::image`` object. Supports
       the following data types:

       -  Matrix for 2D or 3D matrix data (see ``image_matrix`` class)
       -  Linear for 1D linear array
       -  Pitch for pitched 2D or 3D memory data (``pitched_data`` class)
   * - Class ``image_matrix``
     - Represents 2D/3D matrix data for an image. It contains the image channel
       information, dimensions, size of each dimension, and the raw data pointer.
   * - Class ``pitched_data``
     - Represents the 2D/3D pitched data for an image.
   * - Struct ``image_channel``
     - Keeps image channel information; including order, data width, and type
       information.
   * - Class ``image_info``
     - Image sampling information; including addressing mode, filtering mode, and
       normalization mode.
   * - ``image_wrapper`` operations API: ``create_image_wrapper()``
     - Creates an object of the helper image class according to the parameters
       provided.



Intel® oneAPI DPC++ Library Specific Utility Helper functions
-------------------------------------------------------------

The helper functions provided by the header files included in ``dpl_utils.hpp``
include algorithm functions, memory functions, iterators, and a container for
managing data on a device.

Algorithm Helper Functions
**************************

The algorithm helper functions are available in the ``dpl_extras/algorithm.h``
header file. Algorithm helper functions are wrappers around |oneDPL_long| algorithm
functions.

**Mask-predicated Algorithm Functions**

Mask-predicated algorithm functions have parameter lists like the algorithms with
the same name in the C++ standard library. These functions accept an additional
iterator pointing to a set of values that indicate whether the corresponding
elements of the other inputs to the function should be processed by the algorithm.
The predicate provided to these functions is applied to a value in the mask,
rather than the element of the input data, and if the predicate returns true the
corresponding element of the input data is manipulated by the algorithm.

The mask-predicated algorithm functions in the ``dpl_extras/algorithm.h`` header
file are:

* ``copy_if``
* ``partition``
* ``partition_copy``
* ``remove_if``
* ``remove_copy_if``
* ``replace_if``
* ``replace_copy_if``
* ``stable_partition_copy``
* ``stable_partition``
* ``transform_if``

**Key-value Pair Algorithm Functions**

Key-value pair algorithm functions have parameter lists like the algorithms with
the same name in the C++ standard library. The functions accept two sets of
input data instead of one: the first representing a set of keys and the second
representing the set of values associated with each key. These algorithm functions
create ``zip_iterators`` and invoke the standard algorithm provided in |oneDPL| so
that the key-value pairs are processed as single data elements.

The key-value pair algorithm functions in the ``dpl_extras/algorithm.h`` header
file are:

* ``unique``
* ``unique_copy``
* ``merge``
* ``sort``
* ``stable_sort``
* ``set_difference``
* ``set_intersection``
* ``set_symmetric_difference``
* ``set_union``

**Additional Algorithm Functions**

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Function
     - Description
   * - ``partition_point``
     - Implementation of the C++ standard library algorithm that accepts an
       execution policy, enabling parallel execution.
   * - ``transform_if``
     - Applies a unary operation to every element in the input for which the
       predicate provided returns true. A mask-predicated version of the
       function is also provided.
   * - ``iota``
     - Extends the C++ standard library algorithm by accepting a step in addition
       to the input iterators and initial value. The step is used to compute the
       next value in the sequence generated.
   * - ``inner_product``
     - Implementation of the C++ standard library algorithm that accepts an
       execution policy, enabling parallel execution. The binary operation
       provided for reduction must be associative and commutative.
   * - ``for_each_index``
     - Assigns each element in the input range provided the result of the
       unary operator invoked with the element’s index in the input range.

Memory Helper Functions
