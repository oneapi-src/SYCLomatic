.. note::

	The SYCLomatic project is the open source release of the IntelÂ® DPC++
	Compatibility Tool and includes the same CUDA to SYCL functionality.

	Samples referenced in the open source documentation may not work as
	described, as they have not yet been tested with SYCLomatic. Testing and updating
	samples for SYCLomatic is a work in progress.
