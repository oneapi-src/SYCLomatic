You can run |tool_name| from the command line and provide migration instructions
by using the tool's command line options. The general command syntax is:

.. code-block::

   dpct [options] [<source0>... <sourceN>]

.. note::

   ``c2s`` is an alias to the ``dpct`` command and may be used in it's place.


To see the list of |tool_name|â€“specific options, use ``--help``:

.. code-block::

   dpct --help
