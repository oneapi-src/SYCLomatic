# SYCLomatic

## Introduction

SYCLomatic is a project to assist developers in migrating their existing code written in different programming languages to the SYCL\* C++ heterogeneous programming model. Final code editing and verification is a manual process done by the developer.

Use c2s command to make it as easy as possible to migrate existing CUDA codebases to SYCL, which is an industry standard. Once code is migrated to SYCL, it can be compiled and executed by any compiler that implements the SYCL specification as shown here:  https://www.khronos.org/sycl/

The SYCLomatic development branch is the SYCLomatic branch.

## Releases

Daily builds of the SYCLomatic branch on Linux and Windows* are available at
[releases](/../../releases).
A few times a year, we publish Release Notes to
highlight all important changes made in the project: features implemented and
issues addressed. The corresponding builds can be found using
[search](https://github.com/oneapi-src/SYCLomatic/releases)
in daily releases. None of the branches in the project are stable or rigorously
tested for production quality control, so the quality of these releases is
expected to be similar to the daily releases.
