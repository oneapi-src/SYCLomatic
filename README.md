## Introduction

SYCLomatic is a project to assist developers in migrating their existing code written in different programming languages to the SYCL\* C++ heterogeneous programming model. Final code editing and verification is a manual process done by the developer.

Use `c2s`(SYCLomatic binary) command to make it as easy as possible to migrate existing CUDA codebases to SYCL, which is an industry standard. Once code is migrated to SYCL, it can be compiled and executed by any compiler that implements the SYCL specification as shown here:  https://www.khronos.org/sycl/

## Releases

The development is in the SYCLomatic branch. Daily builds of the SYCLomatic branch on Linux and Windows* are available at
[releases](/../../releases).
A few times a year, we publish Release Notes to
highlight all important changes made in the project: features implemented and
issues addressed. The corresponding builds can be found using
[search](https://github.com/oneapi-src/SYCLomatic/releases)
in daily releases. None of the branches in the project are stable or rigorously
tested for production quality control, so the quality of these releases is
expected to be similar to the daily releases.

## Build from source code
### Prerequisites

* `git` - [Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* `cmake` version 3.14 or later - [Download](http://www.cmake.org/download/)
* `python 3` - [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* `ninja` -
[Download](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/wiki/Pre-built-Ninja-packages)
* C++ compiler
  * Linux: `GCC` version 7.5.0 or later (including libstdc++) -
    [Download](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/)
  * Windows: `Visual Studio` 2019 or 2022 (In the following description, assume that the version used is 2019) -
    [Download](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

### Create SYCLomatic workspace

Throughout this document `SYCLOMATIC_HOME` denotes the path to the local directory
created as SYCLomatic workspace. It might be useful to
create an environment variable with the same name.

**Linux**:

```bash
export SYCLOMATIC_HOME=~/workspace
export PATH_TO_C2S_INSTALL_FOLDER=~/workspace/c2s_install
mkdir $SYCLOMATIC_HOME
cd $SYCLOMATIC_HOME

git clone https://github.com/oneapi-src/SYCLomatic.git
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
**Windows (64-bit)**:
=======
See [openmp](/openmp) branch.
>>>>>>> origin/sycl

Open a developer command prompt using one of two methods:

* Click start menu and search for "**x64** Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019".
* Win-R, type "cmd", click enter, then run
  `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x64`

```bat
set SYCLOMATIC_HOME=%USERPROFILE%\workspace
set PATH_TO_C2S_INSTALL_FOLDER=%USERPROFILE%\workspace\c2s_install
mkdir %SYCLOMATIC_HOME%
cd %SYCLOMATIC_HOME%

git clone https://github.com/oneapi-src/SYCLomatic.git
```

### Build SYCLomatic


**Linux**:

```bash
cd $SYCLOMATIC_HOME
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PATH_TO_C2S_INSTALL_FOLDER  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang"  -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="X86;NVPTX" ../SYCLomatic/llvm
ninja install-c2s
```

**Windows (64-bit)**:

```bat
cd %SYCLOMATIC_HOME%
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%PATH_TO_C2S_INSTALL_FOLDER%  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang"  -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="X86;NVPTX" ..\SYCLomatic\llvm
ninja install-c2s
```

Note: For build system with 16G or less memory, to avoid out of memory issues,
it is recommended to add the option `-DLLVM_PARALLEL_LINK_JOBS=1` in the CMake step and use 4 or less total parallel jobs when building SYCLomatic by invoking `ninja` with the option `-j4`:
```
ninja -j4 install-c2s
```


**Build success message**:

After a successful build, you should be able to see following message in the terminal output.
```
-- Install configuration: "Release"
-- Installing: ... bin/dpct
-- Creating c2s
```


### Deployment

**Linux**:
```bash
export PATH=$PATH_TO_C2S_INSTALL_FOLDER/bin:$PATH
export CPATH=$PATH_TO_C2S_INSTALL_FOLDER/include:$CPATH
```

**Windows (64-bit)**:
```bat
SET PATH=%PATH_TO_C2S_INSTALL_FOLDER%\bin;%PATH%
SET INCLUDE=%PATH_TO_C2S_INSTALL_FOLDER%\include;%INCLUDE%
SET CPATH=%PATH_TO_C2S_INSTALL_FOLDER%\include;%CPATH%
```

### Verify the Installation
Before running SYCLomatic, it is important to verify that dpct/c2s(SYCLomatic binary) is installed correctly and PATH is set properly.

To do this, try running the following command and checking if dpct is available after the installation.
```
c2s --version
```
Note: If c2s cannot be found, please check the setup of PATH.

## Run SYCLomatic
### Run c2s command
Get c2s help information by running "c2s --help".
dpct is an alias command for c2s.


## Test SYCLomatic 
### Run in-tree LIT tests
SYCLomatic uses [LLVM Integrated Tester](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/lit.html) infrastructure to do the unit test.
Note: Certain CUDA header files may need to be accessible to the tool.
After building the SYCLomatic, you can run the list test by:
```
ninja check-clang-c2s
```

### Run end to end test suite (Recommend for contributors)

The end to end test executes the migration, build and run steps. Follow instructions from the link below to build and run tests:
[README](https://github.com/oneapi-src/SYCLomatic-test)

## Known Issues and Limitations

* SYCL\* 2020 support work is in progress.
* 32-bit host/target is not supported.
