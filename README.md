# SYCLomatic

## Introduction

SYCLomatic is a project to assist developers in migrating their existing code written in different programming languages to the SYCL\* C++ heterogeneous programming model. Final code editing and verification is a manual process done by the developer.

Use c2s command to make it as easy as possible to migrate existing CUDA codebases to SYCL, which is an industry standard. Once code is migrated to SYCL, it can be compiled and executed by any compiler that implements the SYCL specification as shown here:  https://www.khronos.org/sycl/

The SYCLomatic development branch is the SYCLomatic branch.
